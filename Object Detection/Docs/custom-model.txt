1. We need a dataset:
    -> https://universe.roboflow.com

2. The structure of the dataset:
    > test
        > images
            - img 1
            - img 2
            - img 3
            ...
        > labels
            - For each image, we have a corresponding text file that contains all the classifications and their coordinates in the image (normalized values 0 --> 1) (x, y, width, height)

    > train
        > images
            - img 1
            - img 2
            - img 3
            ...
        > labels
            - For each image, we have a corresponding text file that contains all the classifications and their coordinates in the image (normalized values 0 --> 1) (x, y, width, height)

    > valid
        > images
            - img 1
            - img 2
            - img 3
            ...
        > labels
            - For each image, we have a corresponding text file that contains all the classifications and their coordinates in the image (normalized values 0 --> 1) (x, y, width, height)

    - data.yaml: It gatheres all the information

3. Add your dataset to Google drive:
    -> Update the data.yaml file: add the path of the dataset in the drive

4. How to label your own images:
    -> https://github.com/heartexlabs/labelImg
    -> Set your predefined classes
    -> Execute labelImg.exe
    -> Set save format to YOLO

5. Google Colab:
    -> Mount your drive to Google Colab

    >_ !nvidia-smi: Checks if we are using a GPU
    >_ !pip install ultralytics
    >_ from ultralytics import YOLO
    >_ !yolo task=detect mode=predict model=yolov8n.pt conf=0.25 source="https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg": Just a test
    >_ !yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8n.pt data=../content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/DatasetName/data.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640: Train the model
