1. What is Object Detection:
    * Object Detection is a computer vision technique for locating objects in a image or a video.
    * Object Detection gives us the bounding box (x, y, width, height) of an object as well as the classification of that object.
    * Image recognition types:
        -> Object Classification: Identifies what type of object is present in an image          ==> Single class
        -> Object Detection: Identifies and locate the presence of an object in an image         ==> Bounding box, class
        -> Object Segmentation: Identifies and separate the objects in an image on a pixel level ==> The exact shapes of objects

2. Performance Evaluation Matrix:
    * There are two matrixes to evaluate our object detection model:
        => IoU - Intersection Over Union: Evaluate how good is the location ==> 0 --> 1
            IoU  = (Area of Intersection) / (Area of Union)

        => mAP - Mean Average Precision: Evaluate how good is the classification
            Average precision:
                - Confusion matrix

                - Precision
                    Actual positives out of the total positive predictions
                    Precision = (True positives) / (True positives + False positives)

                - Recall
                    Actual positives out of all predictions.
                    Recall = (True positives) / (True positives + False Negatives)
